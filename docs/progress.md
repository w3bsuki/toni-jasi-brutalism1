## Issues and Challenges

### Metadata Warnings
There are currently warnings about unsupported metadata in the console:
```
⚠ Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export.
⚠ Unsupported metadata themeColor is configured in metadata export.
```

This should be addressed by moving these configurations to the viewport export according to Next.js 15 guidelines.

### Performance Considerations
As the product catalog grows:
- Implement proper pagination or infinite scrolling
- Consider server-side filtering for larger datasets
- Add image optimization for product images
